                            Most software teams don’t have a lot of automated tests, and they get away with it because
                            traditional software is deterministic. If it works once, it’ll keep working the same way,
                            and just eyeballing behavior before releases can feel good enough.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            But AI products are different. They’re probabilistic, so their behavior can shift in
                            unexpected ways every time you use them.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Controlled iteration is the only way to ship a reliable autonomous product and actually
                            improve it over time.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For example, one Autonomy customer, a fintech, recently shipped Agents that analyze bank
                            statements and other documents submitted with a business loan application. Their Agents use
                            large language models to extract key data points from those documents. Their Agents also do
                            precise math on the extracted data (for example, calculate the total payroll spend) by
                            autonomously invoking tools written in Python.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Initially, when they tried the first few documents, extraction wasn’t always correct. The
                            agents would sometimes hallucinate the wrong tool call, so the computed values were wrong.
                            They also weren’t sure which language model to use. Did they really need the newest, most
                            expensive models, or could a cheaper one work just as well?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            And this is how all AI products begin. To make progress, you need a systematic approach: one
                            document at a time. This fintech started with the most capable language model and an initial
                            development dataset of 30 documents. For each document, they manually analyzed it, labeled
                            the correct output, and then refined the agent’s prompts and tool descriptions to ensure the
                            output matched the labeled expected result.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Once they got one document to work, they added it to their CI-driven automated evaluation
                            suite. That way, as they moved on to the next document, the automated checks ensured they
                            weren’t breaking what was already working for previous documents. Since agent outputs are
                            probabilistic, each evaluation produced a metric (for example, a success percentage) rather
                            than a simple pass/fail. Each document was checked multiple times to compute those
                            percentages, which let them handle variability and still measure when things were stable,
                            degrading, or improving.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            They defined success thresholds (for example, 95% extraction accuracy and 99% tool-call
                            success). Once all 30 documents were passing these thresholds, they made the agents live. In
                            production, they gathered traces of how the agents behaved on real-world documents, found
                            new document types that caused issues, and then iterated on prompts and inputs again to fix
                            those. Because they had that automated evaluation suite, it ensured prior behavior never
                            broke.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Controlled, iterative refinement is what separates successful autonomous products from
                            failed experiments and demo-ware. With an automated evals, you can also confidently
                            experiment with cheaper or latest models, knowing the tests will catch any regressions.
