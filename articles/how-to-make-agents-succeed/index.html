                                Most software teams don’t have a lot of automated tests, and they get away with it
                                because traditional software is deterministic. If it works once, it’ll keep working the
                                same way, and just eyeballing behavior before releases can feel good enough.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                But AI products are different. They’re probabilistic — their behavior can shift in
                                unexpected ways every time you use them.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Controlled iteration is the only way to ship a reliable autonomous product and actually
                                improve it over time.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                For example, one Autonomy customer, a fintech, recently shipped Agents that analyze bank
                                statements and other documents submitted with a business loan application. Their Agents
                                use large language models to extract key data points from those documents. Their Agents
                                also do precise math on the extracted data — like calculate the total payroll spend — by
                                autonomously invoking tools written in Python.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Initially, when they tried the first few documents, extraction wasn’t always correct.
                                The agents would sometimes hallucinate the wrong tool call, so the computed values were
                                wrong. They also weren’t sure which language model to use — did they really need the
                                newest, most expensive models, or could a cheaper one work just as well?
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                And this is how all AI products begin. To make progress, you need a systematic approach:
                                one document at a time. This fintech started with the most capable language model and an
                                initial development dataset of 30 documents. For each document, they manually analyzed
                                it, labeled the correct output, and then refined the agent’s prompts and tool
                                descriptions to ensure the output matched the labeled expected result.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Once they got one document to work, they added it to their CI-driven automated
                                evaluation suite. That way, as they moved on to the next document, the automated checks
                                ensured they weren’t breaking what was already working for previous documents. Since
                                agent outputs are probabilistic, each evaluation produced a metric — like a success
                                percentage — rather than a simple pass/fail. Each document was checked multiple times to
                                compute those percentages, which let them handle variability and still measure when
                                things were stable, degrading, or improving.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                They defined success thresholds — for example, 95% extraction accuracy and 99% tool-call
                                success. Once all 30 documents were passing these thresholds, they made the agents live.
                                In production, they gathered traces of how the agents behaved on real-world documents,
                                found new document types that caused issues, and then iterated on prompts and inputs
                                again to fix those. Because they had that automated evaluation suite, it ensured prior
                                behavior never broke.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Controlled, iterative refinement is what separates successful autonomous products from
                                failed experiments and demo-ware. With an automated evals, you can also confidently
                                experiment with cheaper or latest models, knowing the tests will catch any regressions.
