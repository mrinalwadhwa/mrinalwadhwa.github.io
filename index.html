                I am founder and CTO of <a href="https://autonomy.computer">Autonomy</a>, a platform that gives you the
                ability to create products that can autonomously perform long and complex tasks.

                <p>
                    For 21 years, my work was focused on designing distributed systems and products that handle large
                    volumes of data.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Early on, I worked on high-availability and replication for network-attached storage at EMC, where I
                    learned how to make complex distributed systems reliable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After that, I spent a few years at SAP, focused on large-scale enterprise data, processes, and
                    systems.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Learnings from these early years apply directly to my work now on autonomous AI agents that
                    collaborate across networks and companies to automate tedious business processes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In 2014, I became CTO of a hardware company that was transitioning into a platform for the Internet
                    of Things. I designed that system and led the deployment of thousands of sensors and controllers
                    embedded in city infrastructure, ports, and more worldwide.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Many of our sensors were machine-learning based and operated in extremely noisy environments, like
                    city streets with power lines, buses, and interference, which taught me how to ship reliable
                    products on top of probabilistic and non-deterministic behavior, a challenge that's acute in all AI
                    products.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Because these systems were embedded in critical infrastructure, like cities and ports, security and
                    trust had to be foundational, not bolted on.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That experience led me to build <a href="https://github.com/build-trust/ockam">Ockam</a>, a
                    collection of protocols and an open-source Rust library for cryptographic identities, trust, and
                    end-to-end encrypted communication in distributed systems.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Autonomy brings together all those experiences to empower teams to ship autonomous products that are
                    dependable, secure, and highly scalable.
